in OSPF NSSA, when we redistribute a network into OSPF, they are flooeded as Type 7 within NSSA. Then they are translated as Type 5 by ABR into other areas.

P-bit standsa for propagate bit and can be found in options filed in Type 7 LSA.  It tells the ABR if this type 7 LSA can be translated into type 5 or not.
only LSA with P-bit will be translated and this bit is set automatically for all redistributed prefixes.

The type "Type 7/5 translation" actually means P-bit.  in Wireshark you will NP bit. 

N-bit: Used in hello packet of OSPF NSSA routers.
P-bit: This one is used in the NSSA external LSA header.

OSPF seperates preserves the ASBR ip address in the field of Forward Address:

If you have two ABRs then there will be a election and router with higest router-id will do the translation. 

Can we filter LSA type 7/ Type5.

There is no way to manually change the P-Bit on cisco routers. If the NSSA ASBR and ABR are both same routers, then it wont set P-bit at all.

or you can use OSPF not-advertise command.

R2 & R3#
(config)#router ospf 1
(config‐router)#summary‐address 4.4.4.4 255.255.255.255 not‐advertise

or use  a distribute-list to filter the routes.
