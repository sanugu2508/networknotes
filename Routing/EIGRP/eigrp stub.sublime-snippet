 EIGRP stub router
 
Some times the link between two eigrp routers has less bandwidth. EIGRP routers generally exchange lot of packets. So if we leave like that, link will be full with eigrp packets only. So if we configure a router as a stub  router, it will reduce number of eigrp packets on that router.
