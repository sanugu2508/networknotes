Palo Alto interfaces are connected to Marvell or Petra chip. 

Marvell will have direct connection with Tiger/Liger chip using Joyal links or lanes. Marvell chip is network processor and hardware accelaration. 

Tiger/Liger chip is connected with Octeaon Chip which is Dataplane CPU. process the packet accordign to life of the packet.

Octean chip is connected with Jaguar Chip which is signature match FPGA.  app id and content id is done here.

Jaguar has AHO and DFA algorithms. 

Dune  chip is switch fabric


AHO: Pattern/signature matching the algorithm for identifying threats and for DLP (Data Loss Prevention) processing.
DFA: Pattern/signature matching the algorithm for identifying applications.
PSCAN: Pattern/signature matching the algorithm for identifying threats. PSCAN is designed to replace AHO.

â€“ On the PA-3000 series platform, DFA and PSCAN are done in the software and AHO is done on the hardware. We can force this to software if we suspect some issue with hardware.

- Running AHO on hardware will reduce the load on dataplane CPU  which is software based.
