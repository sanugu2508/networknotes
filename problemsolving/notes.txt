answer is hiding in plain sight
functional fixedness, we only see what we were told, but do not explore for example the box with pins to light the candle
we dont see it, because we werent instructed to look for it

Misconception - they think difficult must have a complex solution, notice other cards, just not your card

Assumption - we are fixated, and dont think beyond boundaries
Key example, brain fills in missing pieces, we assume what our brain tells us, answer is hiding in plain sight. key is rotating in both directions



Expectations - expectations blind us, and we dont see what is really going on.
shift the expectations to what will work for them, not what will need for them.
