DNS is domain naming system. 

it is used to resolve hostname to ip this is called forward lookup.
we can also resolve ip to hostname this is called reverse lookup.


It uses UDP port 53 for query and response.

It uses TCP port 53 for zone transfer etc.

DNS record types
================

A-Record  maps a FQDN with ip address
CNAME - its an Alias Name. it is used to point to another domain or subdomain.


ANAME (alias) = A+CNAME - it can point to another domain or ip.
SOA (startof Authority) - contains serial number of a zone, ttl and dns cache expiry for a zone.
NS (Name Server) - points to which server is authoritative to a domain. ( for example cloudflare)
PTR (Pointer Record) matches ip address to a domain name.

What is zone transfer?

normally in big organizations, we have lot of DNS servers for high availability. in case one goes down, we can use other one. all those servers share the dns names and ips using zone transfer TCP 53 port. 


The standard order in which Windows resolves names to IP addresses is as follows:
1. Host name (the host itself)
2. DNS resolver cache (the Windows service “DNS Client”)
3. Local hosts file (located in c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts)
4. DNS server
5. NetBIOS cache (can be checked with nbtstat –r)
6. WINS server
7. Broadcasting (yell in the network if someone responds ...)
